        <h1>PORTAL</h1>

<p>The PORTAL project helps protect privacy and ensure anonymity by ensuring that all internet traffic is sent through TOR. PORTAL helps protect your identity and activities online by seamlessly sending all your traffic over the TOR network. This is accomplished by using a personal router that is configured to transparently forward all internet traffic over TOR. The PORTAL itself is one of a range of compact routers from TP-LINK, running a customized OpenWRT firmware. The following TP-LINK models are supported:</p>

<ul>
<li>MR11U</li>
<li>MR3040</li>
<li>MR3020</li>
<li>WR703N</li>
</ul><p>The easiest way to get PORTAL is to purchase a custom modified router with the latest firmware already installed. </p>

<p>For those who want to build and configure their own PORTAL, there is an install guide available. </p>

<h2>Instant PORTAL</h2>

<p>The easiest way to acquire a PORTAL is to purchase a pre-modified, pre-installed router from the PORTAL purchase page. These devices have been custom chipped to have increased internal storage space and double the RAM of a stock router. This additional internal storage space allows TOR to be installed directly onto the device, making it even easier to always be protected by TOR. </p>

<h2>Homemade PORTAL</h2>

<p>Using a stock TP-LINK router it is possible to create a PORTAL, however there are some tricks and additional hardware requirements. A USB 3G modem that supports a microSD card and a microSD card formatted as ext2/3/4 is required. </p>

<h2>Download PORTAL</h2>

<p>PORTAL stage 1 images can be downloaded from PORTAL's GitHub <a href="http://github.com/grugq/portal/downloads">downloads</a>.</p>

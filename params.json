We achieve this by using a personal router that is configured to transparently route everything over TOR. The PORTAL itself is one of a range of compact routers from TP-LINK, running a customized OpenWRT firmware. The following TP-LINK models are supported:\r\n* MR11U\r\n* MR3040\r\n* MR3020\r\n* WR703N\r\n\r\n### Instant PORTAL\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to acquire a PORTAL is to purchase a pre-modified, pre-installed router from the PORTAL purchase page. These devices have been custom chipped to have increased internal storage space and double the RAM of a stock router. This additional internal storage space allows TOR to be installed directly onto the device, making it even easier to always be protected by TOR. \r\n\r\n### Homemade PORTAL\r\n\r\nUsing a stock TP-LINK router it is possible to create a PORTAL, however there are some tricks and additional hardware requirements. A USB 3G modem that supports a microSD card and a microSD card formatted as ext2/3/4 is required.","name":"P.O.R.T.A.L.","tagline":"Personal Onion Router To Avoid LEO","google":""}
